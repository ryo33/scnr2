## Indicating incompatible changes on major version zero

We defined for this project that while being on major version zero we mark incompatible changes with
new minor version numbers. Please note that this is no version handling covered by `Semver`.

# Unreleased

* Add optional `dynamic-state` feature for context-sensitive scanning.
  * Support bounded count state with `state n: count(0..=N);`, `capture("#", n)`, and `validate("#", n, ...)`.
  * Support string state with `state marker: str(r"...");`, `capture(marker)`, and `validate(marker)`.
  * Keep dynamic capture/validation on generated DFA code without adding a runtime regex dependency.
* Add `Scanner::reset_dynamic_state()` on generated dynamic-state scanners.
* Harden DFA minimization so accepting states with different dynamic accept metadata remain distinct.

# 0.5.2 - 2026-04-04

* Packaging metadata improvements for Python release:
  * Update package version metadata to `0.5.2`.
  * Ensure PyPI long description is sourced from `README.md`.
* Dependency updates:
  * Bump `pyo3` from `0.28.2` to `0.28.3`.
  * Bump `rustc-hash` from `2.1.1` to `2.1.2`.
  * Bump `env_logger` from `0.11.9` to `0.11.10`.

# 0.5.1 - 2026-03-22

* Fix and harden the python-release workflow.
  * Add a macOS-specific CI workaround to avoid intermittent maturin download 404 failures.
  * Pin `PyO3/maturin-action` to a fixed commit SHA.
  * Pin `maturin-version` to `v1.12.6` for deterministic builds.
* Merge PR [#43](https://github.com/jsinger67/scnr2/pull/43) from [ryo33](https://github.com/ryo33). Thank you!
  * Fix Unicode and multibyte literal handling in character class generation.
  * Update scanner expectations for multibyte matching behavior.

# 0.5.0 - 2026-01-25

* AcceptData on DfaState is now an Array instead of an Option.

  There can be multiple accept data entries if there are multiple tokens that can be accepted
  at this state. If a token is not accepted because of a failing lookahead, another token could be
  possibly accepted instead.

# 0.4.0 - 2026-01-19

* Add Python bindings for the scnr2 scanner library.
  See new workspace member `scnr2-python`.

# 0.3.3 - 2025-09-19

* Enhance error message for pattern parsing to include input context
* Increased number of tests in the match_test module, especially checking error cases.
  This increases the test coverage significantly.

# 0.3.2 - 2025-08-14

### Summary

* Comprehensive test suite enhancements focused on robustness, edge-case coverage, and performance validation.
* Added extensive fuzz testing, error handling validation, and pathological case benchmarking.
* Improved test organization and documentation for better maintainability and coverage visibility.

  - Memory safety verification under stress conditions

* **Test Organization**
  - Clear separation of concerns between unit, integration, fuzz, and performance tests
  - Improved test naming conventions for better discoverability
  - Enhanced documentation linking between test files and coverage reports

### Security

* **Input Validation Hardening**
  - Comprehensive validation of scanner behavior with malformed UTF-8 input
  - Null byte injection handling verification
  - Memory exhaustion prevention testing with extremely large inputs
  - Buffer overflow prevention validation with pathological token sequences

### Testing Infrastructure

* **Coverage Metrics Enhancement**
  - Normal token scanning validation ✅

  - Boundary condition testing ✅

This release significantly strengthens the reliability and robustness of the scanner through comprehensive test coverage expansion, ensuring stable operation under both normal and extreme conditions.

# 0.3.1 - 2025-08-01

* Fix issue [#735](https://github.com/jsinger67/parol/issues/735) of parol.

  After a newline character the column number is not 0 anymore. The newline logically belongs to the
  current line. Switching to the next line is then done with the next character.

# 0.3.0 - 2025-07-26

### Summary

* Major improvements focused on testing and reliability, highlighted by the addition of a comprehensive test suite.
* Core scanner functionality received performance optimizations and architectural enhancements, while maintaining backward compatibility.
* Documentation and examples were refined for greater clarity and accuracy.


### Extensive Test Suite Addition (Most significant change)

* Added a comprehensive test infrastructure in `match_test.rs`.
  - Tests are now generated using macros for conciseness and maintainability.
* Removed PowerShell automation scripts previously used for test commissioning, as they are no longer needed.


### Core Scanner Implementation Improvements

* Performance: Added `#[inline]` to the `token_type()` method.
* Refactored mode management: `ScannerImpl` and `FindMatches` now use `Cell` for current mode management instead of `RefCell`.
* Improved scanner internals in `find_matches.rs` and `scanner_impl.rs`.


### Documentation and Example Fixes
* README improvements:
  - Corrected token identifiers in examples.
  - Improved regex patterns for comment text handling.
  - Added documentation for lookahead conditions.
  - Fixed function call token regex.
  - Improved string content handling in scanner examples.
* Completed code documentation for use with `cargo doc`.


### Code Generation Updates
* Improved character classes in `scnr2_generate`.
* Updated expected generated code templates.
* Enhanced code generation logic.


### Development Infrastructure
* Added new test workspace configuration.
* Added `CHANGELOG.md`.
