## Purpose & Overview

**scnr2** is a high-performance Rust crate for building custom scanners and lexers with advanced regular expression support, multi-mode state management, and compile-time code generation. Designed for simplicity, speed, and flexibility, scnr2 empowers developers to create robust tokenizers for complex parsing tasks with minimal runtime overhead.

## Key Advantages

- **Blazing Fast:** All scanner logic is generated at compile time using Rust macros, with no runtime regex engine in generated scanners.
- **Ergonomic Macro Syntax:** Define scanners, modes, tokens, and transitions with concise, readable macros—no boilerplate required.
- **Multi-Mode State Machines:** Effortlessly model complex lexing scenarios with built-in support for multiple scanner modes and seamless transitions (`set`, `push`, `pop`).
- **Context-Sensitive Tokenization:** Specify positive/negative lookahead conditions and, with the `dynamic-state` feature, scanner-instance state for tokens whose close delimiter depends on an earlier capture.
- **Full Unicode & Regex Support:** Broad compatibility with Unicode and advanced regex features, including case insensitivity.
- **Extensible & Contributor-Friendly:** Modular design and clear API make it easy to extend, customize, and contribute new features.
- **Python Support:** Official Python bindings are available via the [scnr2](https://pypi.org/project/scnr2/) package on PyPI (`pip install scnr2`). See `scnr2-python` for details.

## Unique Value Propositions

- **Compile-Time Safety:** Catch errors early and eliminate runtime surprises.
- **Minimal Dependencies:** Lightweight footprint for easy integration; generated scanner code does not depend on a runtime regex engine.
- **Production-Ready:** Proven reliability, actively maintained, and well-documented.

## Quickstart Example

```rust
use scnr2::scanner;

scanner! {
    MyScanner {
        mode INITIAL {
            token r"\d+" => 1; // Numbers
            token r"[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*" => 2; // Identifiers
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    use my_scanner::MyScanner;
    let scanner = MyScanner::new();
    let input = "abc 123";
    for m in scanner.find_matches(input, 0) {
        println!("{}: '{}'", m.token_type, &input[m.span]);
    }
}
```

## Advanced Example: Multi-Mode Scanner

This example demonstrates a scanner with multiple modes and transitions, handling strings both inside and outside comments.

```rust
use scnr2::scanner;

scanner! {
    StringsInCommentsScanner {
        mode INITIAL {
            token r"\r\n|\r|\n" => 1; // "Newline"
            token r"[\s--\r\n]+" => 2; // "Whitespace other than newline"
            token r#"""# => 5; // "StringDelimiter"
            token r"/\*" => 6; // "CommentStart"
            token r"[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*" => 9; // "Identifier"
            on 5 push STRING;
            on 6 enter COMMENT;
        }
        mode STRING {
            token r#"""# => 5; // "StringDelimiter"
            token r#"([^"\\]|\\.)*"# => 10; // "StringContent"
            on 5 pop;
        }
        mode COMMENT {
            token r#"""# => 5; // "StringDelimiter"
            token r"\*/" => 7; // "CommentEnd"
            token r#"([^*"]|\*[^\/])*"# => 8; // "CommentText"
            on 5 push STRING;
            on 7 enter INITIAL;
        }
    }
}

const INPUT: &str = r#"Id
"Text with escaped End\""
/* Comment "String in Comment" and "String again" */"#;

fn main() {
    use strings_in_comments_scanner::StringsInCommentsScanner;
    let scanner = StringsInCommentsScanner::new();
    let tokens = scanner
        .find_matches_with_position(INPUT, 0)
        .collect::<Vec<_>>();

    println!("Tokens found: {}", tokens.len());
    for token in &tokens {
        println!(
            "{}: '{}'",
            token,
            INPUT[token.span.clone()].escape_default()
        );
    }
}
```

Sample output:
```
Tokens found: 17
[0..2] tok 9 at 1:1-1:3: 'Id'
[2..3] tok 1 at 2:0-2:1: '\n'
[3..4] tok 5 at 2:1-2:2: '\"'
[4..27] tok 10 at 2:2-2:25: 'Text with escaped End\\\"'
[27..28] tok 5 at 2:25-2:26: '\"'
[28..29] tok 1 at 3:0-3:1: '\n'
[29..31] tok 6 at 3:1-3:3: '/*'
[31..40] tok 8 at 3:3-3:12: ' Comment '
[40..41] tok 5 at 3:12-3:13: '\"'
[41..58] tok 10 at 3:13-3:30: 'String in Comment'
[58..59] tok 5 at 3:30-3:31: '\"'
[59..64] tok 8 at 3:31-3:36: ' and '
[64..65] tok 5 at 3:36-3:37: '\"'
[65..77] tok 10 at 3:37-3:49: 'String again'
[77..78] tok 5 at 3:49-3:50: '\"'
[78..79] tok 8 at 3:50-3:51: ' '
[79..81] tok 7 at 3:51-3:53: '*/'
```

## Advanced Example: Context-Sensitive Tokenization (Rust raw strings)

Enable the optional feature:

```toml
scnr2 = { version = "0.5.2", features = ["dynamic-state"] }
```

Rust raw strings close with exactly the same number of `#` characters used by the opener. That count is not a fixed regular language unless you choose a bound. `dynamic-state` keeps the scanner DFA generated at compile time and stores only the captured count in the scanner instance.

```rust
use scnr2::scanner;

scanner! {
    RawStringScanner {
        state n: count(0..=16);

        mode INITIAL {
            token r"r" + capture("#", n) + r#"""# => 1;
            token r"\s+" => 98;
            token r"." => 99;

            on 1 enter RAW;
        }

        mode RAW {
            token r#"[^"]*"# => 10;
            token r#"""# + validate("#", n) => 20;
            token r#"""# + validate("#", n, 0..n) => 10;

            on 20 enter INITIAL;
        }
    }
}
```

- `state n: count(0..=16);` declares one scanner-instance state slot. The bound keeps all generated automata finite.
- `capture("#", n)` matches zero to sixteen `#` units and stores the matched unit count in state slot `n` after the token is finally selected.
- `validate("#", n)` accepts only when the matched count equals the stored count.
- `validate("#", n, 0..n)` accepts partial closes, such as `"#` inside an `r##"..."##` raw string, without consuming the final close.
- Open-ended constraints use the declared count-state bounds: `..n` means `state_min..n`, `n..` means `n..state_max + 1`, and `..` means the full declared state range.

Dynamic state persists across `find_matches` calls on the same scanner and is not reset by mode transitions. Call `reset_dynamic_state()` when you want to clear captured values explicitly.

## Advanced Features

- **Mode Switching:** Build nested, stateful scanners with `push`, `enter`, and `pop` transitions.
- **Lookahead:** Use `followed by` and `not followed by` for context-sensitive tokens.
- **Dynamic State:** With the `dynamic-state` feature, use bounded `count` or regex-shaped `str` state to implement context-sensitive delimiters without runtime regex matching.
- **Unicode:** Full Unicode support for internationalization.
- **Performance:** Compile-time generation ensures optimal speed.

## Getting Started

1. **Import the macro:** `use scnr2::scanner;`
2. **Define scanner modes and tokens:** Use macro syntax to specify modes, tokens, and transitions.
3. **Instantiate your scanner:** `let scanner = MyScanner::new();`
4. **Scan text:** `scanner.find_matches(input, 0)` yields an iterator of matches.
5. **Get position info:** `scanner.find_matches_with_position(input, 0)` provides line/column data.

## FAQ

**How do I skip whitespaces?**  
Define a token for whitespaces and ignore it, or simply omit a whitespace token—unmatched text is skipped.

**How do I use multiple scanner modes?**  
Define multiple `mode` blocks and use `push`, `enter`, or `pop` transitions.

**How do I detect unmatched input?**  
Add a catch-all token at the end of your mode's token list (e.g., `r"."`) and handle it as an error.
