//! A library for creating scanners in Rust.
//! This library provides a macro to define scanners and their modes, tokens, and transitions.
//! It also includes data structures for implementing a scanner runtime, including a
//! scanner implementation, DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton) states and transitions.
